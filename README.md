👋 Hey There

I’m a 21-year-old developer with a background in mechanical engineering and automation.
My passion is building clean, efficient, and modern digital experiences using JavaScript and React.

I focus on precision, performance, and simplicity — whether in engineering or development. Outside of coding, I enjoy chart analysis, walking, and playing guitar.

🎯 Goals
	•	Become a full-time JavaScript / React Developer
	•	Build tools that solve real problems and help people
	•	Improve daily through learning and consistent coding
	•	Create a portfolio that stands out through quality, not quantity
